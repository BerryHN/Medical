---- "Celeste" - PSD DOll ----

The doll is in one pose only, but includes several combinable expressions, hairs and a few outfits. 
All of them are organized in labeled layers.

Item count:
One body pose
eyebrows x 5
eyes x 7
mouth x 10
bangs x 5
back hair x12
tops x 5
bottoms x 4
full outfits x 2
glasses x 3

Each element consist in one to four layers, consisting mainly in lineart (elementname_lin), color (elementname_col) and shadow (elementname_shadow).
You can change the colors on the color layer and the shading won't be affected. To do so you can do it playing with the hue/saturation of the color layer (in Photoshop, Ctrl+U), or coloring directly with a brush or paint bucket.


Feel free to edit the elements or add new ones to fit your needs.


If you plan to use Celeste in any project, please give me proper credit!!
Feedback is much apreciated!
Enjoy!
