Thank-you for downloading the parts ^_^

The parts are so people can customize their characters more without using the
creator. I suggest you use a program like Paint.NET for these or photoshop.

If you DO use these parts or the creator, please link back to http://allinardo.deviantart.com/
and credit me!

Overall there were 1000+ image files for the creator, but not all the colors or designs
in the world for the more creative people. You may edit these any way you like, but
please don't claim them as your own. The drawing is based off of Kanade Tachibana from
Angel Beats, but were made 100% by me(no tracing in other worlds)...

If you use Paint.NET a suggested plug-in would be the Color Replaces, the one I used to
make all of the colors for these outfits in the first place.
