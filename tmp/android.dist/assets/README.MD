#What is this about?
I am a medical doctor. I am pasionate with technology. I try to tell some of the cases I attened when I was an intern in Chitr√©. 

This is an *interactive graphic novel* developed using **Ren'py** (a graphic novel framework for *Python*). 
In this interactive graphic novel, you must take decisions that lead each of the simulated patients to go back home... or just *die*!

#Installation
