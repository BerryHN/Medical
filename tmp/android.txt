I'm compiling a short test program, to see if you have a working JDK on your
system.




Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "game/mobilebuild.rpy", line 194, in call
  File "/home/tom/ab/x64lucid-deps/install/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 710, in __init__
  File "/home/tom/ab/x64lucid-deps/install/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 1335, in _execute_child
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

I was unable to use javac to compile a test file. If you haven't installed
the Java Development Kit yet, please download it from:

The JDK is different from the JRE, so it's possible you have Java
without having the JDK. Without a working JDK, I can't continue.
