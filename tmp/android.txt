I'm compiling a short test program, to see if you have a working JDK on your
system.





The JDK is present and working. Good!

Apache ANT has already been unpacked.

The Android SDK has already been unpacked.

I'm about to download and install the required Android packages. This might take a while.
SWT folder '/usr/share/games/renpy/rapt/android-sdk-r24.4.1/tools/lib/arm' does not exist.
Please export ANDROID_SWT to point to the folder containing swt.jar for your platform.




I was unable to install the required Android packages.
